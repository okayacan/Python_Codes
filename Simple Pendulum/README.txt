Simple Pendulum:
Here's a simple Python code for simulating a simple pendulum using the physics principles of pendulum motion. 
You can customize the parameters like pendulum length, initial angle, and time step according to your needs.
In this code, we use the equations of simple harmonic motion for a pendulum to simulate its motion. 
The pendulum's angle as a function of time is calculated, and the results are plotted.
You can adjust the length, initial_angle, time_step, and total_time variables to modify the pendulum's characteristics and simulation duration. 
The code uses the matplotlib library for plotting, so make sure you have it installed in your Python environment.
This code provides a basic simulation of a simple pendulum's motion, and you can further enhance it or integrate it into more complex physics simulations if needed.



Damped Oscillator:
Here is a Python code for simulating a damped simple harmonic oscillator using the equations of motion. 
You can customize the parameters like mass, spring constant, damping coefficient, initial displacement, initial velocity, time step, and total simulation time according to your needs.
In this code, it is used the equations of motion for a damped harmonic oscillator to simulate its motion. 
The displacement and velocity as functions of time are calculated, and the results are plotted.
