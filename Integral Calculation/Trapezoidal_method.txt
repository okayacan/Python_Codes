Here's a Python script that calculates the definite integral of a function using the Trapezoidal Rule. 
You need to provide the function you want to integrate, the lower and upper bounds of the interval, and the number of subintervals (n) for the approximation.
You can define your function in the f(x) function. 
The trapezoidal_rule function takes the function f, lower and upper bounds a and b, and the number of subintervals n as input. 
It then calculates the definite integral using the Trapezoidal Rule.
