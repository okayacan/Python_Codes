The Hénon map is a mathematical map that describes a discrete-time dynamical system. 
It's commonly used to visualize chaotic behavior.
We define the parameters 'a' and 'b' for the Hénon map and specify the number of points to generate. 
The initial conditions for 'x' and 'y' are set, and then we iteratively apply the Hénon map equations to generate the points.
Finally, we use matplotlib to create a scatter plot of the Hénon map.
